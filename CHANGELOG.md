# Changelog

All notable changes to rustango. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project loosely follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/) — with the caveat that nothing pre-1.0 has a stability guarantee.

## [Unreleased] — v0.3.1 polish pass

Hardening pass after the v0.3 review. Plugs the loud-failure-mode footguns surfaced when slicing 0-7 were exercised end to end. No new public surface beyond `unapply_force`, `detect_unsupported_field_changes`, and `manage::run_with_writer`.

### Added
- **Concurrent-migrate advisory lock.** `migrate`, `migrate_to`, `unapply`, `downgrade`, and `migrate_embedded` serialize through `pg_advisory_lock(MIGRATE_LOCK_KEY)` so peer boots no longer race into PK violations on the ledger.
- **Prev-chain validation in `file::list_dir` and `migrate_embedded`.** A migration declaring `prev: "0001_missing"` whose predecessor isn't in the directory now fails at load time with a clear "broken migration chain" error rather than surfacing as an opaque failure deep inside `unapply`.
- **`migrate::detect_unsupported_field_changes`** + matching guard in `make_migrations_from`. Type changes (`i32 → i64`), nullability flips, default changes, `max_length` changes, FK target changes, primary-key changes, and `min`/`max` (CHECK) changes used to silently produce no diff. They now return `MigrateError::Validation` with one diff line per change, naming the column and the v0.4 `AlterField` deferral.
- **`unapply` head check + `unapply_force` escape.** Refusing to unapply a non-head migration prevents leaving the schema with newer migrations still applied on top of a rolled-back predecessor. `unapply_force` bypasses for surgical correction.
- **`tracing` integration** at apply/unapply boundaries (`info!` per migration with `migration` field). Optional dependency, surfaces in any `tracing-subscriber` setup.
- **`manage::run_with_writer`** — same dispatcher as `manage::run` but writes to a caller-supplied `&mut W: Write + Send` for testable / capturable / redirectable output. `manage::run` is now a thin wrapper around `run_with_writer(&mut std::io::stdout())`.

### Documentation
- This `CHANGELOG.md` for v0.2 → v0.3.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-28

On-disk migration files, autogeneration from registry diffs, ledger-tracked apply/rollback, and a Django-style `manage.py` analog. Slices 0-7 of the v0.3 plan; slice 8 (Rust callbacks) deferred.

### Added
- **`#[rustango(default = "...")]` attribute** for column DEFAULTs. Required when adding a non-null column to an existing table — Postgres needs the default to backfill rows. Verbatim Postgres expression: numeric literal, quoted SQL string, function call, etc. (Slice 0)
- **On-disk migration file format** — JSON, one file per migration, lex-sortable name (`0001_initial.json`). Carries the migration name, RFC3339 timestamp, optional `prev` predecessor, `atomic` flag, full `SchemaSnapshot` at this point, and a flat `forward: Vec<Operation>` list interleaving `Schema(SchemaChange)` and `Data(DataOp)` ops. `DataOp` pairs forward `sql` with `reverse_sql` (or `reversible: false` for one-way migrations). (Slice 1)
- **`migrate::make_migrations(dir, name)`** — diff the inventory registry against the latest snapshot, write the next migration file. Auto-derives names: `initial` for the first run; `create_X` / `drop_X` / `add_C_to_T` / `drop_C_from_T` for single-shape changes; `auto` otherwise. `name` overrides. `make_migrations_from` exposes the testable form taking the snapshot as input. (Slice 2)
- **`__rustango_migrations__` ledger table** + **`migrate::migrate(pool, dir)`** runner. Each pending migration applies in its own transaction by default (per-file `atomic: false` opts out). `ensure_ledger`, `applied_set` are public for callers that want their own runners. (Slice 3)
- **`invert::invert`** computes the inverse op list from a forward op list + predecessor snapshot; **`migrate::unapply(pool, dir, name)`** rolls back a single migration. Schema reversal uses the snapshot at the predecessor; data reversal uses the migration's `reverse_sql`. Irreversible migrations fail fast before any DB write. (Slice 4)
- **`migrate::migrate_to(pool, dir, target)`** walks forward or back to a named migration in lex order. `target == "zero"` unapplies everything. **`migrate::downgrade(pool, dir, n)`** steps back the `n` most recent. (Slice 5)
- **`migrate::manage::run(pool, dir, args)`** Django-style dispatcher. Subcommands: `makemigrations [name]`, `makemigrations --empty <name>`, `migrate`, `migrate <target>`, `downgrade [N]`, `showmigrations` / `status`, `--help`. Users drop a `src/bin/manage.rs` 5-line entrypoint to wire it up. (Slice 6)
- **`embed_migrations!("./migrations")`** proc-macro + **`migrate::migrate_embedded(pool, &[(name, json)])`** runner. The macro `include_str!`s every `*.json` in the directory at compile time and emits `&[(&'static str, &'static str)]` so single-binary deployments don't ship a migrations folder alongside the binary. (Slice 7)

### Fixed
- FK `ALTER TABLE` constraints emitted by `CreateTable` are now **deferred to the end of a migration's forward execution**, so two `CreateTable` ops in one migration where one FKs the other no longer fail because the referenced sibling table doesn't yet exist. `RenderedBatch::deferred_fks` exposes this split for callers. ([b2b9334](https://github.com/ujeenet/rustango/commit/b2b9334))

### Notes
- The `embed_migrations!` macro relies on `include_str!`, and **cargo doesn't watch directory listings** — adding or removing a migration file requires `cargo clean` to refresh the bake. Real footgun in active development.
- `DROP TABLE … CASCADE` is the default for `DropTable`. Not configurable; cascades to dependent FKs and views silently.
- Schema reversal restores **shape, not data** — `DropColumn` then `unapply` does not bring back the column's row values.
- Slice 8 (Rust callbacks for data migrations) was descoped from v0.3.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-27

Schema snapshots, diff/render to DDL, admin polish.

### Added
- **`SchemaSnapshot` IR** capturing every registered model's table + column metadata as JSON. Round-trips through serde for migration files.
- **`diff::detect_changes(prev, current)`** computes a `Vec<SchemaChange>` (CreateTable / DropTable / AddColumn / DropColumn) from two snapshots. **`diff::render_changes`** writes the changes as Postgres DDL. Type/nullability/PK/CHECK/FK changes were silently dropped — fixed in v0.3.1. (Slice 5)
- **Admin LEFT JOIN support** — list views render FK columns as `<a href="/<target>/<pk>">display_value</a>` using a single LEFT JOIN per FK column at query time. No N+1. (Slice 4)
- **Admin Tera templating** — list / detail / new / edit / delete pages baked from a templates directory via `include_str!`. (Slice 3)
- **Admin search and per-field filters.** `?q=foo` substring search across `max_length` String fields; `?<column>=v` per-field filter; both compose with `?page=N` pagination. (Slice 2)
- **Admin renders FK columns as links** to the target row's `display` field. (Slice 1)
- README and `repository` Cargo metadata for crates.io publish prep. (Slice 6)

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04 (pre-history)

Initial workspace scaffolding through the first usable axe of the framework.

### Added
- **Workspace scaffolding** — 7-crate split: `rustango-core` (IR, registry traits), `rustango-macros` (`#[derive(Model)]`), `rustango-query` (typed `QuerySet<T>`), `rustango-sql` (Postgres writer + executor), `rustango-migrate` (DDL writer + bootstrap runner), `rustango-admin` (auto-CRUD over the registry), `rustango` (facade re-exports).
- **`#[derive(Model)]`** populates `inventory` for the registry-driven admin. `#[rustango(table = "...")]`, `#[rustango(primary_key)]`, `#[rustango(column = "...")]`, `#[rustango(fk = "...", on = "...")]`, `#[rustango(o2o = "...", on = "...")]`, `#[rustango(display = "...")]`.
- **`User::objects()`** typed `QuerySet`. Per-field zero-sized types in a hidden module (`User::id`, `User::name`) carry `Column` impls with `Eq`/`Ne`/`Lt`/`Lte`/`Gt`/`Gte`/`Like`/`In`/`IsNull` ops. Both typed (`User::id.eq(10)`) and string-keyed (`.filter("id", Op::Eq, 10)`) forms exist; mix freely.
- **INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE** — IR, Postgres writers, executors, per-instance `insert(&pool)` / `delete(&pool)` derived methods. Bulk via `User::objects().filter(...).update().set(...).execute(&pool)` and `.delete(&pool)`.
- **Per-field bounds** — `#[rustango(max_length = N)]`, `#[rustango(min = N, max = M)]` translate into VARCHAR length, CHECK constraints, and pre-DB validation in `validate()`.
- **LIMIT / OFFSET, COUNT, admin pagination, HTTP Basic auth** for the admin.
- **Admin CRUD** — list, detail, new, edit, delete forms over registry models.
- **`rustango-admin`** auto-CRUD router over the inventory registry. Zero per-model wiring — every derive shows up.
- **Postgres DDL writer** in `rustango-sql` + **`migrate::apply_all(&pool)` / `migrate::drop_all(&pool)`** for fresh-DB bootstrap.
